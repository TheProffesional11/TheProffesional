                    Drive Train:
                    Our Drive Train consists of 4 Mecanum wheels which allow us to perform extreme maneuvers on the field.
                    One of the most important benefits of this system is our ability to go around the field quickly and accurately without changing the robot’s direction using an algorithm called Field Oriented.
                    This subsystem’s structure is made out of primarily wooden plates, to keep our robot’s weight as low as possible and allow us to accelerate to our max speed as fast as possible.
                    Our gear ratio is 1:17.3, which allows us to reach extremely high velocities, and be one of the fastest robots on the field.

                    Intake:
                    Our Intake has 2 rollers, which allows us to collect freight and transfer it to our deposit mechanism efficiently and quickly. In this system we use 2 motors with a gear ratio of 1:5, which distribute their power equally to both rollers. Both rollers are made of latex tubing, which grips the freight and pulls it in.

                    Deposit:
                    Our Deposit is assembled from 3 main parts:
                    Lift - allows us to extend the Deposit higher to reach the upper level of the Alliance Shipping Hub.
                    Storage/Kicker - stores the freight until we are ready to deposit it, then pushes it out with a 3D printed part mounted on a servo.
                    Extending Bars - 2 bars connected to servos, that extend the storage out and reach further and higher to allow us to score to both Shipping Hubs more efficiently and accurately.

                    Team Shipping Element:
                    Our TSE system is a very unique system which picks up the TSE with the use of a magnet.
                    It uses four servos: the first one allows circular movement on the X axis; the second servo moves around the y axis; the third servo controls the angle of the end unit, and ensures that the end unit is perpendicular to the floor when we pick up the TSE, and angled when we attempt to place it on the hub to minimize driver error; and the last servo is in charge of moving the magnet in the end unit, with which the arm will let go of the TSE with the touch of a button.
                    The third servo which changes the angle of the end unit is placed close to the base of the arm to lower the torque, and with that, the servo which raises and lowers the arm needs less power. The servo is connected to the end unit with the use of a rod mechanism which transfers the rotation of the servo to the end unit.

                    Carousel system:
                    Our carousel system is built of a motor with a gear ratio of 1:14 and a rubber wheel with a 24 mm radius. This gives high friction allowing us to spin the carousel as fast as possible without dropping the duck and without losing control of the spinning movement.
